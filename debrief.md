## Debrief

* Know your audience.
* Be aware your audience may not understand concepts like 'square wave'
* take time to make sure they have the background (without over doing it with theory)
* explain x and y axes on graphs first
* demo an oscilloscope, show different wave types. use the scope to see things like square wave forms when you probe a clock in a circuit
* keep and extend the hands on materials
* keep the requirements analysis, shows engineering is more than the technical things (user centric design, requirements, cost, safety etc)
* have another look at day 3
* consider an activity that demonstrates the different comms options (I2C, SPI etc). Keep it simple.
* Have some step by step designs (maybe ohotos or graphics) fot the first Arduino exercise. Like Lego instructions. If people get lost and you don't have loads of helps then they can troublshoot better by themselves. Not everyone likes to ask for help either.
