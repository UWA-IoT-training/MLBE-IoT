# MLBE_IoT_Crash_course

Marshall Lab Biomedical Engineering Internet-of-Things Crash course

## Learning outcomes:
At the end of this course participants should be able to:  

1. Assemble elements of a COTS system (microcontroller, camera/sensor and code).
2. Visualise data collected by the camera/ sensor on a suitable device.
3. Store and edit their code on GIT.
4. Present their learning journey. 

Each session is in 2 parts, (A) a material delivery part ~45 mins and a (B) a practical doing part ~45 mins. There are 2 sessions each day.

## Proposed format - 4 x 0.5 day sessions

Each session needs to have  

a. Learning outcome(s)

b. Agenda

c. List of activities (if any)

d. Who is coordinating/ involved in material development and delivery

e. Any tools, resources and code needed

## Draft outline (3 hrs per day)

### Day 1
1. Introductions (Melinda)

2. Elements of a COTS data collection system: microprocessor, sensors, communications, power, storage, code (data and settings), enclosure. (Ben's Slides, Aiden?)

3. Overview of the device and its design intent and business case (Melinda)

4. Introduction to breadboards and multimeter. Basic topology of circuit. (Aiden)

Activity: identify parts, understand supply chain, costs, look at spec sheets. Find a component race (cheapest cost, meet specs and delivery time). Winner gets component prize. PLay with simple circuit. 

5. Medical device Risk assessment amd standards IEC 60601-1. TGA checklists. [Link](http://www.pacificcrn.com/Upload/file/201705/06/20170506193715_57243.pdf) (Aiden, Toby and Nick)


### Day 2
1.  Briefing: Using Arduino nano, adjustable LED, download code to arduino (Aiden, Thomas, Nick, Patrick)

Activity: Make a light blink with button,  

2. What's happening. Voltage levels 3.3v/ 5v, scanning code to understand what's going (Nick)

3. Introduction to the microcontroller and parts for the demo (ESP32 with camera module) and sensor (camera?). Describe USB to serial card. (Nick, Toby)

Activity: Make it blink every time it takes an image. Introduce the ESP32 and parts. Upload code to the ESP. 

4. Review of resources to help and Toby's goody bag of bits. (Toby)

### Homework over the weekend
Self practice to make their ESP32 microcontroller work and to explore using it (change settings). Let us know in Teams how you are doing.

### Day 3
1. Demo of their device and something unique they did. 

2. Exploring comms options (Aiden, Patrick, Thomas)

Activity: get various comms options working and troubleshooting

3. Discuss data and storage options (Patrick, Thomas, Nick)

Activity: Collecting and viewing data collected

### Day 4
Activity: Everyone to demo their device and describe 

1. Putting it all together: overview of end to end process (Melinda, Aiden)
 
2. Describe/ demo 3D printing (Patrick)

3. Develop PCB minaturisation, reliability, etc.(talk to EE), writing specifications, costs, web app, resources. (Aiden, Toby, Melinda)

4. Wrap up -  what we learned, what we wished we'd learned, how to run the next course. Follow up plans. (Melinda)

## Prior to the course each participants must do the following:

1. Join the course Teams account
2. Set up a Git Hub account and post their address to the Teams channel.
3. Download Arduino and download library
4. Brings laptop
5. Briefing note, welcome to the course, times/dates, what to bring, where we are, safety induction (Patrick, Thomas to write up Melinda/Aiden to send out)
