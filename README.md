# MLBE_IoT_Crash_course

Marshall Lab Biomedical Engineering Internet-of-Things Crash course

## Learning outcomes:
At the end of this course participants should be able to:  

1. Assemble elements of a COTS system (microcontroller, camera/sensor and code).
2. Visualise data collected by the camera/ sensor on a suitable device.
3. Store and edit their code on GIT.
4. Present their learning journey. 

Each session is in 2 parts, (A) a material delivery part ~45 mins and a (B) a practical doing part ~45 mins. There are 2 sessions each day.

## Proposed format - 4 x 0.5 day sessions

Each session needs to have  

a. Learning outcome(s)

b. Agenda

c. List of activities (if any)

d. Who is coordinating/ involved in material development and delivery

e. Any tools, resources and code needed

## Draft outline (3 hrs per day)

### Day 1
1. Introductions

2. Elements of a COTS data collection system: microprocessor, sensors, communications, power, storage, code (data and settings), enclosure. 3. Introduction to breadboards and multimeter. Basic topology of circuit.

Activity: identify parts, understand supply chain, costs, look at spec sheets. Find a component race (cheapest cost, meet specs and delivery time). PLay with simple circuit.  

3. Overview of the device and its design intent and business case

4. Medical device Risk assessment amd standards IEC 60601-1. TGA checklists. [Link](http://www.pacificcrn.com/Upload/file/201705/06/20170506193715_57243.pdf)


### Day 2
1.  Briefing: Using Arduino nano, adjustable LED, download code to arduino
Activity: Make a light blink with button,  

2. What's happening. Voltage levels 3.3v/ 5v, digital binary conversions, scanning code to understand what's going 

3. Introduction to the microcontroller and parts for the demo (ESP32 with camera module) and sensor (camera?). Describe USB to serial card. Make it blink every time it takes an imageIntroduce the ESP 32 and parts. Upload code to the ESP. 

4. Review of resources to help.

### Homework over the weekend
Self practice to make their ESP32 microcontroller work and to explore using it (change settings)

### Day 3
1. Demo of their device and something unique they did.

2. Exploring comms options

Activity: get various comms options working and troubleshooting

3. Discuss data and storage options

Activity: Collecting and viewing data collected

### Day 4
Activity: Everyone to demo their device and describe what they learned and what questions they have

1. Putting it all together: describe/ demo 3D printing

2. Describe next steps: minaturisation, reliability, etc.

3. Wrap up - what we learned, what we wished we'd learned, how to run the next course




## Prior to the course each participants must do the following:

1. Join the course Teams account
2. Set up a Git Hub account and post their address to the Teams channel.
3. Download and register for PCB CAD software selected and Arduino
4. ....
