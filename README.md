# MLBE_IoT_Crash_course

Marshall Lab Biomedical Engineering Internet-of-Things Crash course

## Learning outcomes:
At the end of this course participants should be able to:  

1. Assemble elements of a COTS system (microcontroller, camera/sensor and code).
2. Visualise data collected by the camera/ sensor on a suitable device.
3. Store and edit their code on GIT.
4. Present their learning journey. 

Each session is in 2 parts, (A) a material delivery part ~45 mins and a (B) a practical doing part ~45 mins. There are 2 sessions each day.

## Proposed format - 4 x 0.5 day sessions

Each session needs to have  

a. Learning outcome(s)

b. Agenda

c. List of activities (if any)

d. Who is coordinating/ involved in material development and delivery

e. Any tools, resources and code needed

## Draft outline (3 hrs per day)

### Day 1
1. Introductions

2. Elements of a COTS data collection system: microprocessor, sensors, communications, power, storage, code (data and settings), enclosure. 

Activity: identify parts, understand supply chain, costs, look at spec sheets 

3. Introduction to breadboards, multimeter and oscilloscope. Risk assessment.

Activity: build simple circuit 

### Day 2
1. Introduction to the microcontroller and parts for the demo (ESP32??) and sensor (camera?)

Activity: Load code onto the microcontroller

2. Getting data off the microcontroller

### Homework over the weekend
Self practice to make their microcontroller work and to explore using it (change settings)

### Day 3
1. Exploring comms options

Activity: get various comms options working and troubleshooting

2. Discuss power/ battery, data and storage options

Activity: Collecting and viewing data collected

### Day 4
Activity: Everyone to demo their device and describe what they learned and what questions they have

1. Putting it all together: describe/ demo 3D printing

2. Describe next steps: minaturisation, reliability, etc.

3. Wrap up - what we learned, what we wished we'd learned, how to run the next course




## Prior to the course each participants must do the following:

1. Join the course Teams account
2. Set up a Git Hub account and post their address to the Teams channel.
3. Download and register for PCB CAD software selected and Arduino
4. ....
