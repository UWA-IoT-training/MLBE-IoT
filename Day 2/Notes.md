# Day 2 Outline

## Session 1 - 9:00 - 9:50 Arduino Basics
Presenter: Aiden Taba
Support: Nick Sadovnikov, Tommo Morton, Patrick Morton

1. How to use the Arduino Nano
* Connecting to your computer
* Connecting components to it
* How to upload code 


### Activity: Make a light blink with button
1. Find the example code "Blink"
2. Modify it to make the blinking button-controlled
3. Connect the circuit
4. Test circuit to see if it works - if not then troubleshoot 

## Session 2 - 9:50 - 10:15 What's going on: Voltage (logic) levels and understanding the code
Presenter: Nick Sadovnikov
Session Development:

1. Understabding logic levels
* How bits are communicated with voltage levels (= logic)
* Brown out
* Use of different logic levels (e.g. 3.3V vs 5V

2. Code run-through
* Understanding the different sections of the code
* Brief overview of what different commands do 


## Break 10:15 - 10:30 

## Session 3 - 10:30 - 11:45 Getting to know the ESP32
Presenter: Nick Sadovnikov
Session Development:

1. Introduce the ESP32
* How to program it
* How to connect to it


2. Introduce the camera
* How to connect it
* How to use it
* How to access the image 

### Activity: Smile! You're on Camera :)
1. Set up circuit
2. Connect to ESP32
3. Upload the code
4. Connect to the camera feed

## Session 4 - 11:45 - 12:00 Useful resources and Toby's goody bag of bits
Presenter: Toby Digney???
Session Development:

1. Run through useful resources (that will assist with the weekend homework)
2. Toby's goody bag of bits and what to do with it
