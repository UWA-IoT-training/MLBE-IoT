### Session 2 - 9:30 - 9:45 - Overview of the device and its design intent and business case  

Barry(15 mins)

### Session 3 - 9:45 - 10:15 - Elements of a COTS data collection system

Presentation on elements of a typical MEMS-IOT system: microprocessor, sensors, communications, power, storage, code (data and settings), enclosure (30 mins)
 
* Presenter: Aiden Taba

### BREAK 15 - 10:15 - 10:30

### Session 4 - 10:30 - 10:45 - Introduction to breadboards. Basic topology of circuit. 

* Presenter: Aiden Taba
* Session development: ?? TBA (doesn't have to be a ppt)
* Activity: Play with simple circuit.

### Session 5 - Game 10:45 - 11:45

* Game coordinator: Aiden Taba
* Game development (what are we going to do, what parts needed, etc.) TBA
* Activity support: Nick Sadnovnikov, Patrick Morton, Tommo Morton

Activity: identify parts, understand supply chain, costs, look at spec sheets. Find a component race (cheapest cost, meet specs and delivery time). Winner gets gift wrapped component prize. 

### Session 6 - 11:45 - 12:15 Medical device risk assessment and standards. TGA checklists.

* Presenter: Aiden
* Presentation development: Aiden has some material from Prof Chinzei from AIST Japan that he presented on IEC 60601-1. Reference also this link https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/essential-principles-checklist-medical-devices.pdf
